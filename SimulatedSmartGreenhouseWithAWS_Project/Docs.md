# Smart Greenhouse Project Documentation

## Project Overview
The Smart Greenhouse project is an IoT-based automated greenhouse management system leveraging AWS services to create an efficient and intelligent plant cultivation environment. The system provides real-time monitoring, automated climate control, and AI-powered plant disease detection capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Hardware Layer**
   - ESP32-CAM module for image capture
   - Temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture sensors
   - Automated control systems (irrigation, ventilation)

2. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - AWS IoT Core for device connectivity
   - Lambda functions for data processing
   - DynamoDB for sensor data storage
   - S3 for image storage
   - Amazon Rekognition for plant disease detection

3. **Application Layer**
   - React-based web dashboard
   - Real-time monitoring interface
   - Mobile-responsive design
